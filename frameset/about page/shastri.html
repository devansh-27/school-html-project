        During his small tenure as Prime Minister from 1964 to 1966, Shastri Ji worked hard and accomplished tasks for which he is known even today. He handled various situations wisely and calmly. The Madras anti-Hindu agitation of 1965 was among one of the
        critical situations the country faced during his time. The Indian government wanted to make Hindi as the national language of the country. This did not go down well with the non-Hindi speaking states such as Madras. Students as well as professionals
        and other people from different walks of life initiated riots and the situation became tensed. The riots came to an end only after Shastri Ji’s assurance that English would continue to be the official language of the non-Hindi speaking states.
