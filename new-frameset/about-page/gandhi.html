    <h1>About Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h1>
    <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi is well known as the "Father of the Nation or Bapu" because of his greatest contributions towards the independence of our country. He was the one who believed in the non-violence and unity of the people and brought spirituality in the Indian
        politics. He worked hard for the removal of the untouchability in the Indian society, upliftment of the backward classes in India, raised voice to develop villages for social development, inspired Indian people to use swadeshi goods and other
        social issues. He brought common people in front to participate in the national movement and inspired them to fight for their true freedom.
