    <h1>About Bhagat Singh</h1>
    <p>
        Bhagat Singh was a hero of the early 20th-century Indian independence movement. He was a vocal critic of British rule in India and was involved in two high-profile attacks on British authoritiesâ€”one on a local police chief and the other on the Central
        Legislative Assembly in Delhi. He was executed for his crimes in 1931 at the age of 23.
