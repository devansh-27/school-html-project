    <h1>About Bhagat Singh</h1>
    <p>
        Bhagat Singh (Punjabi pronunciation: [pə̀ɡət̪ sɪ́ŋɡ] (About this soundlisten) 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero
        of the Indian independence movement.

        In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, British India, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British police superintendent, James
        Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[4] They believed Scott was responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai as a result of having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured, and, two weeks thereafter,
        died of a heart attack. As he exited a police station on a motorcycle, Saunders was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[5] Lying injured on the ground, he was then shot up close several times by Singh,
        the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[6] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police constable, Chanan Singh, who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled.

        After having escaped, Singh and his associates publicly announced avenging Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target, their own names appearing under pseudonyms.[5] Singh was thereafter
        on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two improvised explosive devices inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered
        leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and then allowed the authorities to arrest them.[7] The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh
        gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929. Singh was convicted and hanged
        in March 1931, aged 23.

        Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through
        him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name."[8] In still later years,
        Singh, an atheist and socialist in life, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries,
        were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh.
