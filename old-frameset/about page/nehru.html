        Jawaharlal Nehru’s Involvement in Indian Politics While Gandhiji stayed away from main stream politics, Jawaharlal Nehru became actively involved in the same over the time. His father, Motilal Nehru was an Indian lawyer. He was also a leader of the Indian
        National Congress who became the Congress President twice. It seems that inclination towards politics was thus in the very genes of Jawaharlal Nehru.

        Nehru attained law degree from Inner Temple, London and returned to India in 1912. He enrolled as an advocate at the Allahabad High Court but the work did not interest him. He entered the Indian political scene soon after. He attended the Congress session
        at Bankipore in 1912 however the same did not impress him much. He found the congress party and its people detached from the actual cause. He did not even like the methods followed by his father.

        He was highly impressed by the Gandhian ideologies and participated actively in the 1920 non-cooperation movement led by Gandhiji. He got arrested on account of creating unrest in the country. However, he was released after a few months. After
        this, he was jailed many times for participating in various freedom movements and his popularity as a leader grew.
